!!! - implement info-panel 'hijack' feature. ie: broadcast a specific message to every device playing our stream in place of 'program name & presenters'
---> same thing for the program pic

- sync up info-panel info & icecast metadata (have a centralized web control interface to broadcast the info)

- improve notifications: should include 'program/presenter' info and obviously implement 'hijacked broadcast'

- check for events like "pause" to detect pause from device's controls and sync with our app GUI
