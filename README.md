## Introduction

Radioflow is a GPL online radio app for mobile devices based on Apache Cordova 3.6.

Android and iOS are currently supported.


**This project was developed by [Xicnet.com](http://www.xicnet.com) and financed by Radio Nacional Argentina where it is used for its 5 stations.**


## Installation
In order to build this project, you must have the latest Apache Cordova installed and working.

Assuming you know how to do that or have it already installed, you could do the following:


```
git clone https://github.com/ramahex/radioflow.git

cd radioflow/app/nacionalrock

cordova run android --emulator

```

If everything is properly setup on your side, the emulator should open up and run _Nacional Rock_ station app.

_Note that your emulator needs Internet access to properly work._

In case you find any trouble or bug, please report it!
